<h1>Chris Black</h1>

<p>This page is a placeholder, set up to learn how GitHub Pages deployments
	work.</p>

<p>If you are looking for Chris Black's web presence, please see
	<a href="https://ckblack.org">ckblack.org</a> for personal stuff or
	<a href="https://poolsandfluxes.com">Pools and Fluxes LLC</a> for
	consulting on ecosystem science, biogeochemical models, and scientific
	software development.</p>

<p>If the deployment test works, the following links should serve text that
	lives in other repos: subdirs matched to repo name
	<a href="ghp-test/">ghp-test</a> and <a href="ghp-test2/">ghp-test2</a>;
	subdir differently name <a href="third-ghp-test/">third-ghp-test</a>
	(which is intended to populate from infotroph:ghp-test3).</p>
